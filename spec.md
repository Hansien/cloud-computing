## Introduction

This is an introduction of chatbot from **group H**. We will achieve our chatbot by using **Line**. As the coronavirus is explored in Wuhan and thousands of people are confirmed by it. The Novel Coronavirus has outbreaks the world. Then, we want to contribute our part and the inspire starts here. There are total **three functions** will include in our chatbot which includes data enquiry, material enquiry and news updates.

## 1: Data enquiry

The first function, data enquiry has to include two sub-data which are the new confirmed patient data and the total patient data from the beginning of the first day. These data will help us to know the importance and emergency to the Novel Coronavirus.

## 2: Material enquiry 

Next function includes the material enquiry which can make people easier to acquire information about medical supplies like face masks, gloves and goggles. To be specific, this function has two main channels. First of all, it provides the enquiry about where to buy face masks for citizens which the face masks and alcohol hand-washer have become a very scarce supply, and people have to line up to buy in limited locations. Some retailers have messages from different channels, but most of them need to download their software. We integrate this function in our chatbot, providing the greatest convenience to users so that they can easily get the latest mask sales locations and times while using chat software. Otherwise, some material is not such scarce but not even easy to find. For those material, we also create an auto-reply entrance to help the user to find the information they want.

## 3: News Update

Chatbots combine news captured from various news platforms, including news of increased cases and news about how to avoid getting infected with the virus. People have more opportunities to get detailed information about confirmed patients, such as active areas and going to the hospital before diagnosis. Because the virus is highly contagious and the hospital has limited staff, when individuals have related symptoms such as coughing, sneezing or fever, it is likely to be a general viral infection rather than a coronavirus infection. At this time, it is easy to cross the hospital. Infected with really new coronavirus. So at this time, we will easily find out how to prevent and avoid the infection of the new coronavirus from the chat robot. At the same time, we can also popularize some things during isolation and mini-games to let everyone have some fun from a boring life.
